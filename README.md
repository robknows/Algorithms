# Algorithms
Getting some proper practice writing algorithms and data structures.

# Implemented
- Binary search trees
- Red black trees (not deletion)
- Simplex method for linear programming
- Power iteration
- Back propogation
- Cholesky decomposition
- Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm
- Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm
- Boyer-Moore string matching

# To do
- Patricia tries
- Radix trees
- Ukkonen's suffix tree construction
- Simplex with Bland's rule
- Integer programming with Gomory cuts, Knapsack cover cuts and branch & bound
