# Algorithms
Getting some proper practice writing algorithms and data structures.

# Implemented
- Binary search trees
- Red black trees (not deletion)
- Simplex method for linear programming

# Nearly there
- Back propogation

# To do
- Red black tree deletion
- Patricia tries
- Power iteration
- Ukkonen's suffix tree construction
- At least one distributed algorithm
