# Implemented
- Binary search trees
- Red black trees (not deletion)
- Simplex method for linear programming
- Power iteration
- Back propogation
- Cholesky decomposition-
- Dijkstra
- Kruskal
- Boyer-Moore string matching

# In progress
- Ukkonen's suffix tree construction
- Radix tree search

# To do/find out is too hard
- Patricia tries
- PageRank
- Rubik's cube solver
